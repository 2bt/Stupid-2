This is Stupid 2
================

Stupid is my Computer Graphics Framework which is ment to serve as a nicer
substitution for the non-linux-compatible framework offered by the TUD.

It's not quite a framework really, but rather my solution to [the second task
of the CGI course](http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/index.php?node_id=2840&ln=de).
